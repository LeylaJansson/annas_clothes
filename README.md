# Anna's Clothes

Anna's Clothes is a small charity shop run by four women; Ann-Marie, Natalie, Natasha and Alma. They spend their free time knitting clothes to sell during their town's
winter market, then donate the money to a charity for families in need. The money helps families in need and the sold knitwear is popular gifts, or for use of the buyer themselves!
The program aims to help keep track of sales, surplus and stock, as well as calculate how much stock needs to be done each year. Anna's clothes see being sold out of any type of item as a fail, as there could've been more sales done if they had more stock. On the other hand they do not want too much surplus, even if the surplus is counted into next year's stock.


## Features 

The program takes the sales data provided by the user, calculates surplus and stock for next year. It also updates the sheet for the client.
